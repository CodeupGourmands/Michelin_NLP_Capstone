# Project Overview:
Our Capstone Team Project utilizes Web-scraping & Natural Language Processing to create a predictive model that determines Michelin food star award ratings based on content from the official Michelin review.

Following the *Data Science Pipeline*
First, our team will acquire and prepare the data for exploration. Then, we will explore the data to gain insight on which features to engineer that ultimately improve our model's accuracy. After we create several types of machine learning models that can effectly predict the Michelin food star award rating we will compare each model's performance on training and validate datasets. The model that performs the best will move forward with test dataset for final results. 


# Project Goals:
* Create a model that effectively predicts Michelin food star award ratings based on content from the official Michelin review
* Provide a well-documented jupyter notebook that contains our analysis
* Produce a Final GitHub repository
* Present a Canva slide deck suitable for a general audience which summarizes our findings and documents the results with well-labeled visualizations


# Reproduction of this Data:


# The Plan
* Acquire data from `Michelin Food Reviews` by using `Beautiful soup` to web-scrape the `Michelin Guide`
* Clean data using `RegEx`.
* Prepare data for exploration by:
    * Convert text to all lower case for normalcy
    * Remove any accented characters, special characters, and non-ASCII characters
    * Imputed null values where applicable
    * Tokenized text, lemmatized text, and removed stopwords for exploration and modeling
    * Recasted columns into appropriate data types
    * Store the clean text and the original text for use in future notebooks.
* Explore data to answer the following questions:

    * **Question 1.** What is the distribution of our target variable (award type)?
    
    * **Question 2.** Which countries have the most Michelin Restaurants?

    * **Question 3.** What is the average word count of the restaurant reviews by awards type?

    * **Question 4.** Do 3 star Michelin restaurants have the highest sentiment score?
    
    * **Question 5.** What are the most frequent words used in the Michelin Restaurant reviews?
    
    * **Question 6.** Which counrty has the highest sentiment score?

    * **Question 7.** 


* Develop several models that predict Michelin food star award ratings based on content gathered from the official Michelin review.
    * Fit models on train and validate datasets
    * Compare accuracy scores and select the best model
    * Evaluate the best model on test dataset

* Draw conclusions

## Features
|Feature    |Description       |
|:----------|:-----------------|
|`original`| The original data we pulled from the `GitHub`|	
|`first_clean`| Text after cleaning the `html` and `markdown` code|
|`clean`|Tokenized text in lower case, with latin symbols only|
|`lemmatized`|Lemmatized text|
|`sentiment`|The coumpound sentiment score of each observation|
|`lem_length`|The length of the lemmatized text in symbols|
|`original_length`|The length of the original text in symbols|
|`length_diff`|The difference in length between the orignal_length and the length of the `clean` text|

## Target Variable
|Feature    |Description       |
|:----------|:-----------------|
|`award`|`1 michelin star`, `2 michelin star`, `3 michelin star` or `bib gourmand`|




## Modeling Summary:
- The best algorithm  is `Random Forest Classifier` with following parameters `{'max_depth': 5, 'min_samples_leaf': 3}`
- It predicts the programming language with accuracy:
    - 63% on the train set
    - 48% on the validate set
    - 59% on the test set
- It makes 24% better predictions on the test set that the baseline model.


# Conclusions: 
*The goals of the project were:*
- Scrape Readme files from the GitHub repositories.
- Analyzie the data.
- Build the classification model that can predict the programming language of the repository with the accuracy score higher than 35%.

*Result:*

- Even with the small amount of unorganized data it is possible to perform an exploraion analysis and identify the words that are helping to predict the programming language. We pulled 432 GitHub reposittories with the space theme in four programming languages: Javascript, Java, Python and C#.
- We built the model that has an accuracy scoreof 59%.
- Despite the statistical tests showed that engineered features are not significant, one of our models showed their importance and adding those features to our modeling improved a bit its performance of all of models.


## **Recommendations and next steps:**
- Retrieve more data to train the model on and potentially identify better features for the model.
- Possibly perform less cleaning, leave the code in markdown.
- Collect data on more languages to give the model more utility after production.
