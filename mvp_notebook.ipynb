    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on building a prediction model for accurately predicting the coding language of a project using examination of GitHub repo Readme files. Our goal is to develop a predictive model utilizing Python and Python libraries and select the most effective model for production. Initially, we are utilizing BeautifulSoup to acquire our data, selecting 1000 repositories tagged with 'Minecraft' from GitHub, taking in all Readme text and repo language information from each repo. After gathering the data, we explore the data through questions and visualizations before developing a model that can tell us: \"What language is this repository most likely to be written in?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create deliverables:\n",
    "- READ ME\n",
    "- Final Report (Jupyter Notebook)\n",
    "- Functional acquire.py, explore.py, and model.py files\n",
    "- Acquire data from Michelin Website utilizing Beautiful Soup to scrape restaurant review text\n",
    "- Prepare and split the data\n",
    "- Explore the data and produce visualizations encapsulating exploration\n",
    "- Establish and document baseline\n",
    "- Fit and train a classification model to predict the programming language of the Repo\n",
    "- Evaluate the model by comparing its performance on train utilizing accuracy as a measure\n",
    "- Evaluate the selected model on test data\n",
    "- Develop and document findings, takeaways, recommendations, and next steps"

Of course, all this would be worth nothing without high-calibre cuisine. No worries on that score: chef Christian Sinicropi, a local man, has matters entirely in hand. At each stage of the \"Mouvements\" set menu, he homes in on one ingredient, supporting it with elements from its own ecosystem. The result is coherent and sophisticated, right down to the remarkably precise desserts by Julien Ochando. Definitely worthy of a Golden Palm award.\n"
